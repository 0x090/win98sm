# win98sm

Windows 98 Web Simulator is a simulator made purely in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript (ECMAScript 5) without any libraries.

This project and myself are not associated nor affiliated with Microsoft and there will never be a plan to monetize this project. This project is mostly from my interest in operating systems and programming practise purposes.
