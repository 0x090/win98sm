# win98sm

Windows 98 Web Simulator is an in-development simulator made purely in HTML5, CSS3, and [ECMAScript 5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) without any libraries.

This project and myself are not associated nor affiliated with Microsoft and there will never be a plan to monetize this project. This project is mostly from my interest in operating systems (kernels) and programming practise purposes (in Javascript).
